/**
 * Screens Directory
 *
 * Migration Guide:
 * - Move all screen components from reference project src/screens/ here
 * - Create separate files for each screen (LoginScreen, DashboardScreen, etc.)
 * - Export all screens from this index file for easy importing
 *
 * Example structure:
 * export { default as LoginScreen } from './LoginScreen';
 * export { default as DashboardScreen } from './DashboardScreen';
 * export { default as IncidentScreen } from './IncidentScreen';
