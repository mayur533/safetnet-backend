/**
 * Services Directory
 *
 * Migration Guide:
 * - Move all API calls and external service integrations from reference project src/api/ and src/services/ here
 * - Create separate service files (apiService, authService, locationService, etc.)
 * - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
 * - Add request/response interceptors if needed
 *
 * Example structure:
 * export { default as apiService } from './apiService';
 * export { default as authService } from './authService';
 * export { default as locationService } from './locationService';
 * export { default as notificationService } from './notificationService';
